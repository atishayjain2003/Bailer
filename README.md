Bailer is an automated system to send birthday wishes through G Mail. 
Origin of the problem:
As the social media handler of my organisation i was responsible for wishing everone through stories. It was a tedious task to go through dates everyday to check for birthdays.
I was learning django, so decided to find the solution of the problem.

The solution:
Bailer as a system takes in Name of the society members, their email and their date of birth. With the help of django a backend system is created that sends successful birthday mails to the entered Email ids.

The project is yet to be deployed live.
